Manet’s focus on still lifes coincided with the gradual reacceptance of the genre during the nineteenth century, due in part to the growth of the middle class, whose tastes ran to intimate, moderately priced works. This painting, like many of Manet’s still-life compositions, recalls seventeenth-century Dutch models. The directness of execution, bold brushwork, and immediacy of vision displayed in the canvas, however, suggest why the public found Manet’s work so unorthodox and confrontational. While Fish is indeed an image of “dead nature” (nature morte is the French term for still life), there is nothing still about the work: the produce seems fresh and the handling of paint vigorous. Further enliven-ing the composition is the placement of the carp, which offsets the strong diagonal of the other elements. Manet never submitted his still lifes to the official French Salon but rather sold them through the burgeoning network of art galleries in Paris and gave them to friends.</p>\n", "short_description": null, "dimensions": "73.5 × 92.4 cm (28 15/16 × 36 3/8 in.)", "dimensions_detail": [ { "depth": null, "width": 92, "height": 73, "diameter": null, "clarification": null } ], "medium_display": "Oil on canvas", "inscriptions": "Signed lower right: Manet", "credit_line": "Mr. and Mrs. Lewis Larned Coburn Memorial Collection", "catalogue_display": null, "publication_history": "Paris, Ecole Nationale des Beaux-Arts, Exposition des oeuvres d’Édouard Manet, January 1884, cat. 31.\n\nThéodore Duret, Histoire d’Édouard Manet et de son oeuvre (Paris, 1902), no. 70.\n\nThéodore Duret, Manet and the French Impressionists (London, 1910), p. 220, no. 220.\n\nAntonin Proust, Édouard Manet: Souvenirs (Paris, 1913), p. 54, no. 38.\n\nThéodore Duret, Histoire de Édouard Manet et de son oeuvre (Paris, 1926), no. 70 (ill.).\n\nÉtienne Moreau-Nelaton, Manet: Raconté par Lui-Même (Paris, 1926), vol. 1, pp. 63, 79, fig. 69, vol. 2, fig. 344.\n\nAdolphe Tabarant, Manet, Histoire Catalographique (Paris, 1931), p. 131, no. 90.\n\nPaul Jamot and Georges Wildenstein, Manet (Paris, 1932), vol. 1, p. 128, no. 96, vol. 2, p. 197, fig. 406.\n\nThéodore Duret, Manet, trans.
